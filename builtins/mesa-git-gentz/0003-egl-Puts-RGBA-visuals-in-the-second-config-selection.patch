Subject: [PATCH 3/4] egl: Puts RGBA visuals in the second config selection
 group.

That way applications don't get windows that are compositor alpha-blended
accidentally.

In the ideal world, this would be done by the xserver, as it does for
GLX, however, an appropriate place could not be found, so it's being
placed here instead.

Fixes: 049f343e8ac "egl: Allow 24-bit visuals for 32-bit RGBA8888 configs"
